This starter project showcases a digital twin of a bladeless wind turbine,
simulating its oscillations and how those vibrations generate electricity via electromagnetic induction adn vortex induced vibrations (VIV).
An integrated fluid‐dynamics view visualizes vortex shedding — showing how airflow past the turbine creates alternating vortices.
Try out this demo to see both aerodynamic phenomena in action.
